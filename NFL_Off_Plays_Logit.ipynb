    "This notebook queries and analyzes the data in the MySQL database called NFL_Offensive_Plays_2015, which results from running import_game_pbp_data.py. In particular, for each team, data from plays during the first 8 weeks of the 2015 NFL season--down, distance to go, field position, time remaining, and score differential--are used to train a logistic regression model, which is then used to try to predict whether plays from the last 9 weeks of the season would be runs or passes. In the end, the model makes correct predictions ~2/3 of the time, although it varies from team to team. I wish I had known about the read_sql feature of panas before I wrote this, but oh, well."

These cases are significant, because for these teams it is at least as accurate to guess pass on every play than to use this model. There are three teams for which this is true: the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Jacksonville Jaguars, and the Green Bay Packers. Surprisingly, none of these teams switched offensive coordinators mid-season, which is what I would have expected. For the Steelers, it makes sense: due to a mixture of suspensions and injuries, at different points of the season they did not have access to their starting runningback, wide receiver, and quarterback. This means that playcalling varied from game to game much more than it did for most teams to compensate for the different personnel. The Jaguars also had injuries to several wide receivers and running backs, which perhaps affected their playcalling throughout the season as well. The same is not true for the Packers, although their best wide receiver was out the whole season due to an injury during the preseason. Their offense did struggle early in the season, but largely recovered by the end of the season. Perhaps their play calls early on were different from those later."

In the cells below, I try to find correlations between different measures of predictability (fracCorrect, difference, fracUncertain, fracUncertainOrSureRun) and offensive success (total yards or total points). They are often correlated in the way one would expect (predictabile offenses usually did worse), but none of the correlations were statistically significant with a 95% confidence interval.
